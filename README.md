AppHeads-Localizations
======================

Localization Collection for AppHeads

Do you speak a language fluently? And do you want to contribute to AppHeads?
You can help me and others speaking your language to translate AppHeads in as many languages as possible.

Here is how you can do that:

1. Select the .lproj folder for your language
2. Open the Localizable.strings and/or the DesignView.strings file by viewing it and clicking "Edit".
3. This will create a copy on your github account where you can make changes to it.
4. Once you have finished translating the File(s) you can make a Pull request and I can accept your changes.

Here is what it should look like:
